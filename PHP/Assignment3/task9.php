            It has recently come to the attention of the residents in my area that there has been a extreme disorganization of the facilities in our area. Mainly the squash courts, park maintenance and overall road upkeep.
            Not only were the squash club members complaining of never having a schedule or ability to book as well as the lack of a system to keep track of all the roads to be repaired and park maintenance.
            I plan to resolve this by creating a management system for the community to help plan and organize the community.
